SPRINT WEEK 03/16/2023
Showcased our site progress and spoke about our next steps. We are excited and eager to be working on the photographer's profiles next. We will be working together to get this done instead of us being assigned to different pages like we did the first week. It should take us about a week to get the profiles finished and will be participting in daily stand up meetings to do so.

SPRINT WEEK 03/30/2023
Showcased our teamâ€™s progress in the 2 weeks since Sprint 1. We are very happy with the progress we have made so far. We were able to complete the Photographers page which includes a user authentication, a section to book a session with an admin page where the photographers can see the booked date, we implemented a upload system that allows the photographer to upload a customer gallery and also a section that will display there 3 most recent photos to their profile. In addition, we already have a functioning review section where customers can leave a 1 to 5 star rating. At this time, we do feel we have a reliable MVP and will work to add some additional features like the option to delete a photographer profile, to delete a review and we hope to be able to filter the Photographers by location.
