SPRINT WEEK 03/16/2023
Showcased our site progress and spoke about our next steps. We are excited and eager to be working on the photographer's profiles next. We will be working together to get this done instead of us being assigned to different pages like we did the first week. It should take us about a week to get the profiles finished and will be participting in daily stand up meetings to do so.
